This repository serves as a hub for various Cheat Sheets related to 
the field of Data Science (with Python and R). What sets these Cheat Sheets apart is their 
multidimensional approach to enhancing the learning experience. 
Each Cheat Sheet is made available in three distinct formats: **PDF**, **Streamlit**, and **Google Colab**.

This threefold approach to guarantee that learners can interact with the content in 
a manner that aligns with their preferences and learning style.

> **Note**: This new documentation was developed by [fralfaro](https://github.com/fralfaro). You can find the repository at the following link: [fralfaro/DS-Cheat-Sheets](https://github.com/fralfaro/DS-Cheat-Sheets).

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is a Python 
library that has revolutionized the way data scientists and 
developers can create interactive web applications with ease. 

Unlike complex traditional
web development tools, Streamlit focuses on simplicity and efficiency, allowing you to quickly 
turn your data analysis, visualizations, and models into dynamic and engaging web applications.

[Vizzu](https://vizzuhq.com/) is a free and open-source animated data 
visualization library that utilizes a generic data visualization engine 
to generate various types of charts and seamlessly animate them.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;


It can be used to create static charts, but more importantly, 
it's designed to build animated data stories and interactive explorers.
Vizzu allows displaying different perspectives of the data that viewers can easily follow due to the animation.

The goal of [Kaggle's courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn) is to give you the skills you need to do independent data science projects. 
We pare down complex topics to their key practical components, so you gain usable skills in a few hours (instead of weeks or months).

The courses are provided at **no cost to you**, and you can now **earn certificates**. [Continue reading ➔](https://fralfaro.github.io/kaggle-courses/)

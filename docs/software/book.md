Gain the skills you need to do independent data science projects.

We pare down complex topics to their key practical components, so you gain usable skills in a few hours (instead of weeks or months).

The courses are provided at **no cost to you**, and you can now [earn certificates](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-course-certificates).

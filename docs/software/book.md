This project will provide you with a concise introduction to [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), a document composition system widely used in the academic and technical community.

LaTeX is especially known for its ability to produce high-quality documents that include mathematical content, tables, figures, and bibliographical references.

    &nbsp;📕 12 Chapters<br>
    &nbsp;📅 Sep 10, 2022 <br> <br> <br>
  </span>
</p>



The goal of [Kaggle's courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn) is to give you the skills you need to do independent data science projects. 
We pare down complex topics to their key practical components, so you gain usable skills in a few hours (instead of weeks or months).

The courses are provided at **no cost to you**, and you can now **earn certificates**.

For a long time, the built-in search plugin didn't allow for proper segmentation of Chinese characters, mainly due to missing support in lunr-languages which is used for search tokenization and stemming. The latest Insiders release adds long-awaited Chinese language support for the built-in search plugin, something that has been requested by many users.

Configuration Chinese language support for Material for MkDocs is provided by jieba , an excellent Chinese text segmentation library. If jieba is installed, the built-in search plugin automatically detects Chinese characters and runs them through the segmenter. You can install jieba with: pip install jieba The next step is only required if you specified the separator configuration in mkdocs.yml . Text is segmented with zero-width whitespace characters, so it renders exactly the same in the search modal. Adjust mkdocs.yml so that the separator includes the \\u200b character: plugins : - search : separator : '[\\s\\u200b\\-]' That's all that is necessary. Usage If you followed the instructions in the configuration guide, Chinese words will now be tokenized using jieba . Try searching for \u652f\u6301 to see how it integrates with the built-in search plugin. Note that this is an experimental feature, and I, @squidfunk, am not proficient in Chinese (yet?). If you find a bug or think something can be improved, please open an issue .","title":"Chinese search support \u2013 \u4e2d\u6587\u641c\u7d22\u200b\u652f\u6301"},{"location":"blog/demo/#chinese-search-support","text":"Insiders adds experimental Chinese language support for the built-in search plugin \u2013 a feature that has been requested for a long time given the large number of Chinese users.

These repositories are only a packages transform from R to Python. fastmatrix : Fast computation of some matrices useful in statistics Yet another R package for matrices. It contains a small set of functions to fast computation of some matrices and operations useful in statistics. HEAVY : Robust estimation using heavy-tailed distributions Functions to perform robust estimation considering heavy-tailed distributions. Currently, the package includes linear regression, linear mixed-effect models, multivariate location and scatter estimation, multivariate regression, penalized splines and random variate generation. L1pack : Routines for L1 Estimation Provides routines to perform L1 estimation for linear regression, evaluation of density, distribution function, quantile function and random number generation for univariate and multivariate Laplace distribution. MVT : Estimation and testing for the multivariate t-distribution This package contains a set of routines to perform estimation and inference under the multivariate t-distribution. These methods are a direct generalization of the multivariate inference under the gaussian assumption. In addition, these procedures provide robust methods useful against outliers. SpatialPack : Tools for assessment the association between two spatial processes This package provides tools to assess the association between two spatial processes. Currently, four methodologies are implemented: A modified t-test to perform hypothesis testing about the independence between the processes, a suitable nonparametric correlation coefficient, the codispersion coefficient, and an F test for assessing the multiple correlation between one spatial process and several others. Functions for image processing and computing the spatial association between images are also provided.
